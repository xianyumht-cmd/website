# Cloudflare Pages Custom Caching Rules
# These rules override the default caching behavior to ensure the site is both fast and always up-to-date.

# 1. HTML Files: NEVER CACHE
# Ensures users always get the latest version (which points to the correct hashed JS/CSS files).
/*.html
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate

# 2. Root path (Home page)
# Explicitly disabling cache for the root URL.
/
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate

# 3. Static Assets (Vite generated): CACHE FOREVER
# These files have hashes in their names (e.g., style.a1b2c3.css), so they never change.
# We can safely cache them for 1 year.
/assets/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

# 4. Data Files (if any exist directly): CHECK FOR UPDATES
# If you have JSON or other data files that don't get hashed, ensure they are revalidated.
